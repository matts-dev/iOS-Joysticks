# iOS-Joysticks | [**Demo Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7oGaM9VOQ)

Classes I wrote for implementing joy sticks using iOS's sprite kit library; please see the video below.
The images are under copyright (which I lack permission to share any further than this demo), so they may not be used.
However, feel free to use the code in your own projects; just swap out the images.
This project also serves as a good starting point for a game developed for iOS.
The code wasn't intended to be shared (this was mostly a proof of concept) so the documentation may be lacking. 
I may update if there is interest. The code to create a scene with an actor sprite and grass are provided to demo the joy sticks; 
you use that code also. Please provide a reference to this git page if you decide to use and or modify the code in your project. :)
